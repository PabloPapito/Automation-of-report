# Automation-of-report
Tools: Python, Pandas, Plotly, Plotly.Express, Glob, OS

This automation of weekly report was needed to increase productivity and efficiency of my team. But first of all also to save our time.

First step was to download files and it was related with another automation in my repository which named "Automation_of_downloading_issues_12_files".
Then I needed to merge those few files but to two different files under specified criteria. In the deeper analyse I also needed to merge only to one file.
During analyse I wanted to and was obligated to extract from data counts, sums, min, max.

We didn't need it but it was good excercise and practice to create charts to show some values and visualize how data is spread out.

But of course please bear in mind that this is code to use into my organization, and will not work on your computer because restricted access. So you may just see the code of my work. You can explore may work but please remember that this is just to get familiar with my work. This code will not work on your computer and I needed to modified the data.
