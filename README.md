# Automation-of-report
Tools: Python, Pandas, Plotly, Plotly.Express, Glob, OS

This automation of weekly report was needed to increase productivity and efficiency of my team. But first of all also to save our time.

First step was to download files and it was related with another automation in my repository which named "Automation_of_downloading_issues_12_files".
Then I needed to merge those few files but to two different files under specified criteria. In the deeper analyse I also needed to merge only to one file.
During analyse I wanted to and was obligated to extract from data counts, sums, min, max.

We didn't need it but it was good excercise and practice to create charts to show some values and visualize how data is spread out.
